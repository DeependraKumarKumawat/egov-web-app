# Auto generation of UI
### ui-auto-gen is tool to generate reactJS UI specs.

### How to use
- Create Contract yml
 In contract we have a section where we put ui-info.yml reference.
 Example contract (SWM): https://github.com/egovernments/egov-services/blob/master/docs/swm/contract/v1-0-0.yaml 
 ``` x-ui-info:
  $ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egovernments/egov-services/master/docs/swm/contract/vfd-ui-info.yaml

```
 Reference of ui-info-yml : https://github.com/egovernments/egov-services/blob/master/web/ui-auto-gen/docs/ui-info-schema.yml. This reference file will explain you the terminologies used while writing ui-info yml.
 SWM example : https://github.com/egovernments/egov-services/blob/master/docs/swm/contract/vfd-ui-info.yaml
 - Once you are done with writing contract and ui-info.yml, run this tool to generate ui component.

 Â  - Go to react-pgr-web -> src -> components -> framework -> specs, create a folder with module name and put renamed _autoui.js file in module folder.
   - copy default.json (formatted one) and paste it in react-pgr-web -> src -> components -> common -> common.js
